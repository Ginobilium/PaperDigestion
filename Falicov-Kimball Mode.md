# Falicov-Kimball Model

* The “Falicov-Kimball model” was first considered by Hubbard and Gutzwiller in 1963-
65 as a simplification of the Hubbard model. 

* Falicov and Kimball introduced in 1969
a model that included a few extra complications, in order to investigate **metal-insulator**
phase transitions in rare-earth materials and transition-metal compounds
